# MPA---Jukebox
jukebox

Something went wrong with the previous repo. Because of that, I had to make a new one.
That's why it has not so many commits.

It's a jukebox made with the Laravel Framework.
You can add songs to your queue.
If you want to save your queue in form of a playlist, you can do that by making an account first.
You can edit and delete your queue.
You can also make a playlist and add songs to them, which you can also delete.
If you delete the whole playlist, the songs will go as well
